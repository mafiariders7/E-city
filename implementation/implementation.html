       <p class="text1"> 1.  Collaborate With Stakeholders:</p> A City Is Only As Smart As Its Connectivity To Its Constituents. A Successful Smart City Plan Relies On The Involvement Of Our Cityâ€™s Citizens, Businesses, And Other Stakeholders. <br>
 So Now The Question Is, What Should One Do To Increase Collaboration? <br>
Spread The Word Of This Initiative And Host Public Forums. <br>
These Forums Should Be Accessible, Well- Advertised, And Should Educate Citizens On What Smart City Technology Can, And Cannot, Do For Them. <br>
<p class="text1">2. Create Your Smart City Plan: </p> Once Stakeholders Have Identified Key Areas For Improvement, It Is Our Job To Create The Execution Plan.<br>
The Plan Should Define What Being A Smart City Is To Your City.<br>
The Merit Of A Smart City Plan Is In Its Foundation Of Stakeholders Needs.<br>
Improving Education, Safety, Roadways, Other Infrastructure, Utilities, And Health Services Are Just Some Of The Areas That Can Be Improved By The Implementation Of Smart Technology.<br>
<p class="text1">3. Prioritize Implementation Efforts:</p>  It Maybe Tempting To Immediately Pursue Grandiose, Sweeping Changes. Usually, These Changes Require The Most Capital And Time- Two Resources  A Stakeholder Will Be Most Hesitant To Provide.<br>

<p class="text1">4. Developing Strong Partnerships: </p> Partnering With Organizations,  Both Local And National, Will Allow You To Harness Knowledge And Reputation From Experts In The Fields Affected. <br>
An Affiliation With Renowned Firms, Universities, And Agencies Will Provide Assurance To The Public Prior To The Completion Of The Project. <br>

<p> Smart City Technology Is Already Benefiting Many Cities.
As Our Company Is Current, No Units Are Yet Been Sold. But This Is Our Commitment To Exert To Enhance The Dealings Of Our Company In Couple Of Months. </p>
