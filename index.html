      <h1>The boom of E-vehicles</h1>
      <p>Today when the world is thriving to use day by day new technology everywhere, Electric Vehicles must be the future means of transport. Pollution, growing demand for fuel, Global Warming, promoting eco-friendly means of transport are some of the reasons for promoting electric vehicles. </p>
        <br>
        <p>
       <h2> Electric Vehicles</h2>
        Electric Vehicles are means of transport that consume eclectic energy as fuel instead of traditional fuels such as petrol, diesel, and CNG. These vehicles may be powered through a collector system by electricity from off-vehicle sources or maybe inbuilt with a battery, solar panels, fuel cells, or an electric generator to convert fuel to electricity. Electric bikes, electric cars, electric rickshaws, etc are some examples of electric vehicles. Most of the trains including metros are already running worldwide through electricity.</p>
        <br>
      <p> <h2> Need of Electric Vehicles</h2>
        These are following factors which creates urgent need for use of electric vehicles:
        
        To reduce pollution <br>
        To conserve non-renewable natural resources<br>
        To reduce import of petrol and diesel<br>
        To promote use of renewable energy<br>
        To reduce global warming<br>
        To fulfill the need of growing demand of more means of transport.<br></p>
        The world population is increasing drastically day by day and the demand of means of transport also growing proportionally. Thus demand of fuel is also increasing.  Too much smoke comes out from traditional vehicles this cause air pollution which take many lives every year.</p>
